# mathsynth
A user-unfriendly synthesizer that gives very precise control

This is a practice project to learn more about acoustics and signal processing. One can make simple music with it. The main features are the precise control over each sound. This is a mathematicians perspective so the typical oscillators are hidden away and one is encouraged to use functions instead. Check the examples for advice on use.

I intend to build on this in the future. At some point, a move to a more powerful language is necessary. Compile times are 20+ seconds already. In the near future, the ability to change tempo during a piece is something that I'm looking to do. Implementing a legato-like effect is a plan as well. Perhaps lingering sounds. Who knows?
